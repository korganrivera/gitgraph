# gg: gitgraph

Display a graph like github's contributions graph, given some csv file that contains timestamps and event counts.

## Description
I want a git-like graph to display exercise info from silvercheetah's tss.log. I want it to show me on which days I worked out, and also to highlight which day of the week I work out the most.

The graphics are provided by UTF-8 characters that I'm just going to pretend are strings to avoid having to work with unicode in C. :octocat:
